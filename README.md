## Project

This is my first Three.js project, I did it after following the course [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by Bruno Simon.

## Model

I made the model myself in blender and used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OUFT-hAYho) as an inspiration.

## Water

I used Perlin noise in the water shaders to generate the waves.
